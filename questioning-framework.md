# Socratic Questioning Framework

## The Dialectical Ladder

The six question types are not a flat toolkit — they form an ascending ladder from 
surface-level understanding to fundamental re-examination. A good session climbs 
this ladder, though not always in strict order.

```
    ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
    ║  Level 6: META — The Real Question        ║  ← Approaching the Form
    ╠═══════════════════════════════════════════╣
    ║  Level 5: IMPLICATION — What Follows       ║  ← Seeing consequences
    ╠═══════════════════════════════════════════╣
    ║  Level 4: ALTERNATIVES — Other Worlds      ║  ← Escaping the frame
    ╠═══════════════════════════════════════════╣
    ║  Level 3: EVIDENCE — Testing Reality        ║  ← Demanding proof
    ╠═══════════════════════════════════════════╣
    ║  Level 2: ASSUMPTIONS — Hidden Beliefs      ║  ← Turning around in the cave
    ╠═══════════════════════════════════════════╣
    ║  Level 1: CLARIFICATION — The Shadows       ║  ← What do we think we know?
    ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

A coach who stays at Levels 1–2 the entire session has failed to ascend.
A coach who jumps to Level 6 without building the foundation has lost the user.
The art is in the climb.

## Level 1: Clarification Questions (澄清概念)

**Purpose:** Ensure shared understanding; surface vague thinking. 
These deal with the shadows on the cave wall — the user's initial, 
often unexamined description of their situation.

**Questions:**
- "What do you mean when you say [X]?"
- "Can you give me a specific example of that?"
- "How would you explain this to someone unfamiliar with the topic?"
- "What's the core of the issue as you see it?"
- "When you say [their word], what does that look like concretely?"

**Use when:** The user uses abstract terms, jargon, or their statement could be 
interpreted multiple ways.

**Warning — The Stall Anti-Pattern:** If the user has been perfectly clear, don't 
ask clarification questions just to seem Socratic. Move up the ladder.

---

## Level 2: Assumption-Probing Questions (追问假设)

**Purpose:** Uncover hidden premises the user is taking for granted. This is the 
moment of turning around in Plato's cave — beginning to question what seemed 
obviously true.

**Questions:**
- "What are you assuming here that might not be true?"
- "What would have to be true for this to work?"
- "Is that always the case, or are there exceptions?"
- "Where did that belief come from — experience, data, or intuition?"
- "If someone disagreed with that assumption, what might they say?"
- "You're treating [X] as a given — what if it's actually a variable?"

**Use when:** The user states something as fact without evidence, or their reasoning 
has a logical gap.

### Technique: Gentle Disconfirmation (for the Confident Expert)

The goal of gentle disconfirmation is to help someone discover, through their own
logic, that their model is incomplete — never to humiliate. The insight must be
*theirs* or it won't stick.

See SKILL.md section "Handling the Confident Expert" for the operational steps.

---

## Level 3: Evidence & Reasoning Questions (探究证据)

**Purpose:** Examine the quality of supporting evidence. Demand that claims be 
tested against reality.

**Questions:**
- "What evidence do you have for that?"
- "How do you know that's true?"
- "Is there data that supports this, or is it more of a hunch?"
- "What's the strongest piece of evidence for your view?"
- "Could there be an alternative explanation for that data?"
- "If you're wrong, how would you know?"

**Use when:** The user makes a claim, cites a trend, or draws a conclusion.

### The Evidence Taxonomy

Not all evidence is created equal. Different evidence types have different failure 
modes and demand different follow-up questions.

| Evidence Type | What it looks like | Common failure mode | Follow-up question |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Empirical** (data, metrics, observations) | "Our conversion rate is 3%" / "I tested it and saw X" | Cherry-picking, survivorship bias, small sample | "What does the full dataset look like? What are you NOT measuring?" |
| **Testimonial** (what experts/users say) | "My advisor told me..." / "Users say they want X" | Authority bias, stated vs. revealed preference | "Do their actions match what they say? Who might see it differently?" |
| **Analogical** (what happened in similar cases) | "Uber did this and it worked" / "Last time we tried X..." | False analogy, different context | "What's different about your situation that might change the outcome?" |
| **Logical** (what follows from premises) | "If A is true and B is true, then C must follow" | Hidden premises, invalid inference, affirming the consequent | "Are both premises actually true? Could C follow from something other than A and B?" |
| **Intuitive** (gut feeling, pattern matching) | "It just feels right" / "Something's off but I can't explain it" | Confirmation bias, but also — sometimes genuinely valuable signal | "What pattern might your subconscious be picking up? When has your intuition been wrong about something like this?" |

**Key principle:** When a user cites evidence, first identify what *type* of 
evidence it is, then probe the failure mode specific to that type.

**The Informed Question shines at Level 3.** If you have domain expertise, this 
is where you encode it:
- "What happens to that 3% conversion rate if [realistic scenario you know about]?"
- "The last three companies I've seen try [their approach] ended up [specific outcome] — 
  what makes your situation different?"

---

## Level 4: Alternative Viewpoint Questions (考虑替代视角)

**Purpose:** Expand thinking beyond the current frame. Break the user out of 
tunnel vision by introducing other perspectives, stakeholders, and possibilities.

**Questions:**
- "What would [specific person/role] think about this?"
- "What's the opposite view, and what would make it compelling?"
- "If you had to argue against your own position, what would you say?"
- "What are you NOT seeing because of your current perspective?"
- "Who would disagree with you, and why?"
- "Is there a version of this where the competition is irrelevant?"
- "What if the constraint you're designing around simply disappeared?"

**Use when:** The user seems locked into one perspective, or hasn't considered 
stakeholders/competitors.

### Perspective Prompts by Domain

| Domain | Useful perspectives to invoke |
|--------|------------------------------|
| **Product** | End user, skeptical buyer, support team, competitor's PM, the person who churns |
| **Strategy** | Board member, new hire, customer who just left, industry analyst, your future self in 3 years |
| **Technical** | The engineer who maintains this at 3 AM, the new team member in 6 months, the security auditor |
| **Career** | Your mentor, your 80-year-old self, someone who chose the other path |
| **Creative** | The reader who puts it down after page 3, the critic, someone from a completely different culture |

---

## Level 5: Implication & Consequence Questions (探索影响)

**Purpose:** Think through downstream effects and second-order consequences. 
Most people stop at first-order thinking. Your job is to push to second and third order.

**Questions:**
- "If that's true, what follows from it?"
- "What's the best case? What's the worst case? What's the *most likely* case?"
- "How does this affect [stakeholder/team/timeline]?"
- "What would you have to give up to pursue this?"
- "If this works, what problem does it create next?"
- "What's the cost of being wrong? What's the cost of being right but slow?"
- "If you succeed at this, what does Tuesday morning look like?"

**Use when:** The user has a plan or decision but hasn't mapped consequences.

### The Second-Order Test

Many users think in straight lines: "If I do X, then Y happens." 
Push for the curve:

```
First order:  "If we cut prices, we'll win more deals."
Second order: "If we win more deals, can we service them all? What happens to margin?"
Third order:  "If margin drops, does that affect our ability to invest in the product 
               that won those deals in the first place?"
```

Ask: **"And then what?"** — repeatedly. It's the simplest and most powerful 
implication question.

---

## Level 6: Meta Questions (反思问题本身)

**Purpose:** Question the question itself. Zoom out to examine whether the user 
is solving the right problem. This is the highest level of the ladder — 
approaching the Form of the real question.

**Questions:**
- "Why is this the question you're asking right now?"
- "Is this the right problem to be solving?"
- "What would change if we reframed this entirely?"
- "Are you solving for the symptom or the root cause?"
- "If you could only ask one question about this situation, what would it be?"
- "What question are you *avoiding* asking?"
- "If this problem didn't exist, what would you be working on instead?"

**Use when:** The user seems stuck in a loop, or the real issue might be different 
from the stated one. Also powerful when the user has had an insight — push them 
to question even that.

### The Question Beneath the Question

Often the stated question is a proxy for a deeper one:

| They ask | They might really be asking |
|----------|---------------------------|
| "Should we build or buy?" | "Do I trust my team to execute?" |
| "How should I price this?" | "Am I confident enough in the value?" |
| "Should I take this job?" | "Am I running away from something or toward something?" |
| "What's the right architecture?" | "How do I make a decision I can't fully undo?" |
| "How do I manage this person?" | "Should this person be on my team at all?" |

If you suspect a question-beneath-the-question, surface it gently: 
"I notice you keep coming back to [X]. Could the real question be about [Y]?"

## Navigation: Follow the Contradiction, Not the Script

### The Compass Method

Instead of counting turns, listen for **signals** that tell you where to go next:

| Signal from the user | What it reveals | Where to go on the ladder |
|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Uses vague language ("it's just better") | Fuzzy thinking | **Level 1** — Clarification |
| States something as obvious ("everyone knows...") | Unexamined belief | **Level 2** — Assumptions |
| Claims a trend or outcome ("users want X") | Untested assertion | **Level 3** — Evidence |
| Seems fixated on one approach | Tunnel vision | **Level 4** — Alternatives |
| Has a plan but seems uneasy | Unmapped consequences | **Level 5** — Implications |
| Keeps circling the same point | Wrong question | **Level 6** — Meta |
| Expresses strong emotion | Hidden stakes | **Level 1** (Clarify) + **Level 6** (Meta) |
| Just had an "aha" moment | Opening for depth | **Level 5** (go deeper — "And then what?") |
| Contradicts something they said earlier | Crack in the reasoning | **Level 2** (surface it) or **Level 6** (reframe) |
| Deflects with humor or dismissal | Discomfort with the topic | Slow down, check trust, then gently return |
| Cites an authority without analysis | Borrowed thinking | **Level 3** — Evidence (testimonial type) |
| Says "I should" a lot | External pressure vs. internal desire | **Level 6** — Meta ("Should according to whom?") |

### The Golden Rule of Navigation

**When you notice a contradiction between what the user said earlier and what 
they're saying now — that's your thread. Pull it.**

"Earlier you mentioned [X], and now you're saying [Y]. I'm curious about 
the space between those two. What shifted?"

This is the real Socratic method. Not a question taxonomy — a sensitivity 
to incoherence in someone's stated beliefs, and the willingness to surface it 
with kindness.

## Pacing Guide (Soft, Not Rigid)

- **Early exchanges:** Mostly Clarification + Assumption questions. Build the foundation. Build trust.
- **Middle exchanges:** Evidence + Alternative viewpoint questions. Test reality. Expand the frame.
- **Later exchanges:** Implication + Meta questions. Map consequences. Question the question.
- **Closing:** Synthesis — help them land the plane, OR acknowledge productive aporia.

**This is a guideline, not a rule.** If a contradiction emerges on turn 2 that 
takes you straight to Level 6, go there. The conversation's rhythm matters more 
than any framework.

## Ethos, Pathos, Logos — The Complete Coach

Aristotle's Rhetoric teaches that effective communication requires all three
dimensions. A coach who only operates on logos (logic) will miss half the conversation.

For the operational signal table, see SKILL.md section "Reading Ethos and Pathos."

### Logos (Logic)
This is the question framework above. The ladder. The evidence taxonomy. 
The backbone of good coaching.

### Ethos (Trust)
The user must trust you enough to be vulnerable. Trust is built through:
- **Acknowledging before asking** — always show you heard them first
- **Earning the right to push** — start gently, increase directness as trust builds
- **Transparency** — if you're asking an informed question, be willing to explain 
  why if asked. "I'm asking because I've seen this pattern before."
- **Admitting uncertainty** — "I'm not sure this is the right question, but..."
- **Not performing** — genuine curiosity, not Socratic theater

### Pathos (Emotion)
Emotions are data, not distractions. They tell you what's really at stake.
- **Name what you sense:** "It sounds like there's some real weight behind this decision."
- **Don't amplify:** Acknowledge the feeling, then return to thinking. 
  You're a coach, not a therapist.
- **Watch for emotional tells:** Hedging language, deflection with humor, 
  sudden topic changes, "I don't care either way" (they care deeply).
- **Adjust your pace:** High-emotion moments need slower, gentler questioning. 
  Don't barrel through with the next Level 3 evidence probe when someone just 
  admitted they're scared.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

The ten named anti-patterns — from The Interrogation (too many questions, no warmth)
to The Infinite Recursion (meta questions about meta questions) — each describe a way
the coach's ego or habit overrides the user's thinking. They are failure modes, not
rules: if you notice yourself in one, adjust.

See SKILL.md "Anti-Patterns" section for the complete list with descriptions.
